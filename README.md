Tutorial to learn ZCM and CMake

Please run the install script in scripts/install-zcm.sh. You can do this with the command `./scripts/install-zcm.sh`

Then follow the [zcm tutorial](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/maav/team/software/zcmcmake?authuser=1).

You are finished with the tutorial if you send "hello world" from one application to another.

For more help with CMAKE you can see the [README here](https://github.com/maavumich/cmake_tutorial/blob/master/README.md)
